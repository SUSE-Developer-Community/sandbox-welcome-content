## Purpose

### What can I build in this sandbox?

Anything! This getting started guide has some very simple examples, but you can host very complex applications in Cloud Foundry.

If you want some suggestions on what to build, join us on our discord to see what others are building!



## Rules and Quotas

### How many Applications can I run?
10

With a total of 2GB of requested ram.

### How many services can I use from the marketplace?

4, This should give you enough to try each of the services.


### Can I install my own Open Service Broker? 

Talk to us, if it's something that we think would be interesting to the whole community, maybe.

### Can I route non-HTTP routes. 

Yes, this is a feature of Cloud Foundry, but we have it turned off by default.

### I want to try something bigger, can I request more capacity?

Yes, depending on the request we can work with you to get more capacity or (more likely) help set up your own cluster.
