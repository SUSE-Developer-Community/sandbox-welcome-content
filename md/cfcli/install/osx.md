To install the cf-cli on a Mac, the package is available in homebrew. 

If you haven't installed homebrew, install it with:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then install the package with:

```bash
brew install cloudfoundry/tap/cf-cli
```
