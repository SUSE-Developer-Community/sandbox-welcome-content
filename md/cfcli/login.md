# Login To Your Account

Once you have installed the cf-cli, we need to log in. In this sandbox environment, we need to log in though our Single Sign On portal. To start the sign on, run:

```bash
cf login -a < TODO  url> --sso 
```
TODO: Fact Check
This will give you a URL to browse to and log in. After you log in, you will get a single use token to copy and paste back into your terminal.

TODO: Maybe have a space that the samples live in as well as the standard dev/test/prod?
With that terminal, you should get the option of which Organization and Space you want to use. For now, select "samples".
