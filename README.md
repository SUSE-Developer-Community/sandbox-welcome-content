# Welcome Content for SUSE Dev Sandbox

For our users who aren't experts in Cloud Foundry (Read: most everyone), we would like to provide a good, stress-free introduction. To accomodate different learning styles, each piece of content will eventually be both written examples and recorded videos.

## Why are there a lot of files?

To build the html locally, install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo) then run

```
git clone https://github.com/SUSE-Developer-Community/sandbox-welcome-content.git
cd sandbox-welcome-content
git submodule init
git submodule update
hugo -D
```
