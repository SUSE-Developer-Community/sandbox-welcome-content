# Quickstart

You can access the SUSE CAP Sandbox via the Cloud Foundry command line interface or via the Stratos Web interface. 

## CLI access

I'm assuming you already installed the Cloud Foundry CLI (check [here](/cli/) for detailed instructions regarding CLI use). 

Start the login process with:
``` bash
cf login -a https://api.cap.explore.suse.dev -sso
```

This will return a URL that you need to copy into your browser. This will take you to the login page of the SUSE developer portal. After logging in there, you will receive a one-time token, which you need to copy into your terminal like:
``` bash
cf login -sso-passcode <your token>
API endpoint: https://api.cap.explore.suse.dev
