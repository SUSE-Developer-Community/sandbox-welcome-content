You can also check out the services provided in our environment, by running:

```bash
cf marketplace
```

Which will return the services, the plans offered, any description, and which broker is providing the service. These will be revisited later.

To find more information about a single subcommand, use the help command. For example to get more information about the marketplace command, run:

```bash
cf help marketplace
```

There are a ton of commands accessible through the cf-cli. To get a list of available commands, you can run:

```bash
cf help -a
```
