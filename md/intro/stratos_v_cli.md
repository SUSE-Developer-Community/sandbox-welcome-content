# Stratos vs Command Line

There are two main ways to interact with SUSE Cloud Application Platform: through the GUI (Stratos) or through the cf-cli command line tool. 

Each has it's benefits and target user. For example, the GUI allows you to pull a project directly from git and switch between commits easily while the command line allows you to quickly iterate and test changes that you might not want to commit to git.

Which experience would you like to try out first?
