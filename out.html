<p>In a nutshell, Platform as a Service is about helping developers - you - be more productive. It does that by taking care of things that you would otherwise need to take care of yourself. You have to write and maintain less code, and can focus on writing important code. Let's unpack this a bit more. </p>
<p>Imagine you just got a new laptop. First thing you do is slab your favorite OS on it and then the fun begins. You have to install your favorite editor or IDE, compilers, libraries, debug tools and what have you. Fast forward a few hours and you're slowly getting to a point where your new tool becomes usable. Couple of weeks later something in your toolchain breaks and you have to spend time to fix it. Updates need to be made, dependencies to be considered and managed and so on. Bottomline is, you need to invest a certain amount of your valuable time into building and maintaining your development environment, your workbench so to speak. And this time gets taken away from the time you have to do actually productive things, i.e. write code. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>And so far we have just talked about an individual developer. Imagine your teammates doing the same thing. Which not only causes the time spent on maintaining dev environments to multiply across your team, it also makes everybody end up with a different environment - even if they install exactly the same set of software. There will be version differences of some sort. Security patches come every day. New library versions get published every day. Generally speaking, there's always the possibility that code that runs on your machine doesn't run on your colleague's machine. So additional time needs to be spent on integration work. </p>
<p>Platform as a Service addresses all those problems. </p>
<p>Looking at it from an individual developer's point of view, PaaS makes it possible (but by no means necessary) to avoid composing and maintaining a local build toolchain, since the platform takes care of building your code at deployment time. The only thing you really need locally is an editor or an IDE. You can then push your code to your PaaS cluster and the rest will be taken care of by the platform. </p>
<p>In case of Cloud Foundry, there is a concept called build packs (see https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/), which essentially provides a standardized build environment. Cloud Foundry will inspect your code directory when you push it, and automatically detect the right build pack. In a nutshell, CF tries to detect which programming language you use and if your code makes any assumptions on required build tools like Maven or Gradle. As an aside, you can manually override that automatic choice if you want. </p>
<p>This concept becomes even more beneficial when it comes to harmonizing development environments across teams. Having code built by a build pack ensures that the build environment is exactly the same every time a developer pushes a code change to the platform. Changes to the build environment can be done in a controlled way and happen at the same time for all involved developers and applications. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>TODO: At this point the reader probably wonders how this impacts debugging. While this is beyond this article's scope, I'd like to have a pointer to another article that explains how debugging an app on CF works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another advantage of Platform as a Service is that it can rid a developer from the need to maintain adjacent components. The platform operator usually offers a number of services such as databases, search and analytics engines, etc. Imagine you want to use a database in your app. Normally you would have to install and configure that database yourself to be able to test your code. With PaaS, your platform operator can offer readily available database instances as services that you can bind to your app. So the only thing you need to worry about is the API calls to the database interface in your code. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>TODO: add how service creation and binding can be automated. </p>
  <p>TODO: paragraph on autoscaling</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet another benefit of PaaS is that it helps you avoid writing certain kinds of code that you don't want to write. For example, platforms usually have built-in load balancers and autoscaling capabilities so that the platform can launch additional app instances automatically - you don't have to write the code that does this anymore. This is a very complex topic though, and if you want to dive more into those aspects…</p>

      <h1 id="stratosvscommandline">Stratos vs Command Line</h1>
<p>There are two main ways to interact with SUSE Cloud Application Platform: through the GUI (Stratos) or through the cf-cli command line tool. </p>
<p>Each has it's benefits and target user. For example, the GUI allows you to pull a project directly from git and switch between commits easily while the command line allows you to quickly iterate and test changes that you might not want to commit to git.</p>
<p>Which would you like to try out first?</p>
