# Logging

After you've pushed your app, you may want to check the logs to debug any issues 
or just too see the event history.

To view a stream of your app's logs, run: 

```bash
cf logs <app name>
```

If you want to get a dump of your app's recent logs instead, run:

```bash
cf logs --recent <app name>
```
